# .userParam

The **userParam** method is an **optional** method that adds key-value pairs of end-user-specific information to the process. The provided user parameters are attached to the report which is sent to you as a customer when the end-user completes the loan application process. Attaching end-user-specific information is _optional_ but **strongly recommended** as it allows you as a customer to match the report send by Instantor, with the information collected by you during your application flow.

{% hint style="info" %}
This method accepts and attaches any **key-value pairs** to the report. However, special-purpose keys are listed further down in this section.
{% endhint %}

```javascript
instantor.userParam(key, value)
```

| Argument | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **key** \(string\) | User information key |
| **value** \(string\) | User information value. |

### Example

The following example lists key-value pairs for an end-user their; _first name, last name, social security number and email address:_

```javascript
try {
  const instantor = new Instantor('produktKey.de');
  
  /* Set user-specific parameters */
  instantor.userParam('firstName', 'John');
  instantor.userParam('lastName', 'Doe');
  instantor.userParam('socialsecuritynumber', '1234');
  instantor.userParam('email', 'john@doe.com');
  
  instantor.load('#itor');
} catch(err) {/* Handle error */}
```

### Special-purpose keys

The **userParam** accepts the following special-purpose key:

| Key | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **environment** \(string\)                                                | The environment determines to what endpoint the reports will be sent. If not set in your code, the reports will be sent to the default environment, usually called "production". Other options could include "test". |
