# Introduction

Welcome to the Instantor integration documentation! There are two parts when it comes to getting up and running with Instantor. The Instantor Widget and the Instantor report delivery. In this documentation you will find all the necessary information on how to integrate the Instantor Widget on your website as well as how to prepare for the report delivery. 

![How Instantor works](.gitbook/assets/how-instantor-works-4steps.png)

Generally speaking the Instantor Widget is placed within the loan application flow on the webpage of the client. Once a customer lands the Instantor Widget on the client webpage, this marks the start of the Instantor process. Any data collected from the bank during the process will be encrypted and send as HTTPS POST request to a client's predefined endpoint URL. Meaning you will be required to provide a callback URL to Instantor. Once you have received the report in a JSON format, you will be able to use your decision engine based on the data we provide.
