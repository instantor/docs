# .userParam

The **userParam** method is an **optional** method that adds key-value pairs of user-specific information to the process. The provided user parameters are attached to the report which is sent to the client when the end user completes the process. Attaching user-specific information is **optional** __but strongly suggested as it provides a way of differentiating between end-user related reports.

{% hint style="info" %}
The method accepts any key-value pairs, though special-purpose keys are listed further down in this section.
{% endhint %}

```javascript
instantor.userParam(key, value)
```

| Argument | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **key** \(string\) | User information key |
| **value** \(string\) | User information value. |

### Example

        instantor.userParam('uniqueID', '00000-000-0000')
        instantor.userParam('foo', 'bar')
        
        /* Load the Instantor iframe into the targeted DOM element */
        instantor.load('#itor');
      } catch(err) {/* Handle error */}
```
