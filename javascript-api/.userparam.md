# .userParam

The **userParam** method is an **optional** method that adds key-value pairs of user-specific information to the process. The provided user parameters are attached to the report which is sent to the lending institute when the end user completes the process. Attaching user-specific information is **optional** __but _strongly_ _suggested_ as it provides a way of differentiating between end user-specific reports.

{% hint style="info" %}
This method accepts and attaches any key-value pairs to the report. However, special-purpose keys are listed further down in this section.
{% endhint %}

```javascript
instantor.userParam(key, value)
```

| Argument | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **key** \(string\) | User information key |
| **value** \(string\) | User information value. |

### Example

```javascript
try {
  const instantor = new Instantor('produktKey.de')
  
  /* Set user-specific parameters */
  instantor.userParam('uniqueID', '00000-000-0000')
  instantor.userParam('environment', 'dev')
  instantor.userParam('foo', 'bar')
  
  instantor.load('#itor');
} catch(err) {/* Handle error */}
```

### Special-purpose keys

**userParam** accepts following special-purpose keys for specific use-cases, further described in the [transaction parameter section](.transactionparam.md).

| Key | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **environment** \(string\)                                                | The environment determines which determines which endpoint to send the report to. If not set, the default environment, agreed upon with Instantor, will be used. |
| **firstName** \(string\)          | User's first name, support list of strings delimited by "space". |
| **lastName** \(string\)                                                              | User's last name, support list of strings delimited by "space". |
| **email** \(string\)                 | User's e-mail address. |
| **ssn** \(string\) | User's SSN â€“ social security number. _NOTE, SHOULD THIS BE INCLUDED? WE NO LONGER SUPPORT 'PRE-FILL SSN'. Bojan says we still use ssn in sweden as part of the KYC if it is supplied.. So removing it form the docs wouldn't brake anything.._ |
