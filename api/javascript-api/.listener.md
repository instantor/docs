# .listener

The **listener** method is an **optional** method that attaches end-of-process event listeners that listen for certain events emitted by the frame once the process within the frame finishes - either successful or unsuccessful.

```javascript
instantor.listener(callbackFunction(eventName))
```

Once the callback function is called, the function argument **eventName** will be one of following strings

| eventName | Event description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **process-finished** | The process within the frame finished successfully |
| **process-error** | The process within the frame failed due to unspecified error |
| **invalid-login** | The process within the frame failed due to incorrect bank credentials |
| **timed-out** | The process within the frame failed due to bank communication timeout |
| **too-many-retries** | ????? |

```javascript
try {
  const instantor = new Instantor('produktKey.de')
  
    instantor.listener(function (event) {
        switch (event) {
            case 'process-finished':
                /* Process finished successfully */
                break;
            case 'process-error':
                /* Process failed due to unspecified error */
                break;
            default:
                break;
        }
    })
  
  instantor.load('#itor');
} catch(err) {/* Handle error */}
```
