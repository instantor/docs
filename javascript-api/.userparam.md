# .userParam

The **userParam** method is an **optional** method that adds key-value pairs of user-specific information to the process. The provided user parameters are attached to the report which is sent to the client when the end user completes the process. Attaching user-specific information is **optional** __but strongly suggested as it provides a way of differentiating between end-user related reports.

{% hint style="info" %}
The method accepts and attaches any key-value pairs to report. However, special-purpose keys are listed further down in this section.
{% endhint %}

```javascript
instantor.userParam(key, value)
```
