# .transactionParam

The **transactionParam** method is an **optional** method that adds key-value pairs of transaction-specific information which is used to control the type of report returned to the client. 

```javascript
instantor.transactionParam(key, value)
```

| Argument | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **key** \(string\) | Transaction information key |
| **value** \(boolean\) | Transaction information value. |

### Available key-value pairs

| Key | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **verification** | If set to **true**, the initiated process will test an end-user's identity, provided by the bank, against client-entered information \(via **userParam** method\), and provide results in the report. If end-user information hasn't been provided, report will state that verification has failed. |
| **transactions** | If set to **true**, the report will include information about user's transaction, as provided by the bank. |
| **aggregated** | If set to **true**, the report will be done in aggregated form. ?????? |
| **identificationOnly** | If set to **true**, the report will only contain user information \(no transaction data\) |

```javascript
try {
  const instantor = new Instantor('produktKey.de')
  
  /* Set user-specific parameters */
  instantor.transactionParam('identificationOnly', true)
  
  instantor.load('#itor');
} catch(err) {/* Handle error */}
```
